Source music files by Tom Bailey from Diamond Trust of London

http://diamondtrustgame.com/

These files are all mono and use a 32768 Hz sample rate.  That is the native sample rate on the Nintendo DS platform.

We found that the DS could handle 5 simultaneous audio streams, which we used for up to five instrument tracks, and we set panning manually (even and odd tracks panned a bit to the left and right) for each of these streams to create a stereo spread in the music arrangement.

Tom is fine with people re-using these samples for whatever purpose.  He'd like to receive credit for his work, and if you use these samples in a commercial project that generates a ton of money, he'd like to receive fair royalties.
