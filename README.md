Source music files by Tom Bailey from Diamond Trust of London

http://diamondtrustgame.com/

These files are all mono and use a 32768 Hz sample rate.  That is the native sample rate on the Nintendo DS platform.

We found that the DS could handle 5 simultaneous audio streams, which we used for up to five instrument tracks, and we set panning manually (even and odd tracks panned a bit to the left and right) for each of these streams to create a stereo spread in the music arrangement.

I am fine with people re-using these samples for whatever purpose.  I'd like to receive credit for my work, and if you use these samples in a commercial project that generates a ton of money, I'd like to receive fair royalties.  You can contact me directly here:  thomasrobertbailey@gmail.com

But most importantly, I'd really love to hear what someone else can do with these samples.  I see so much potential here.  I'd be psyched to hear what you come up with, so please send it my way, and don't be afraid to share.
